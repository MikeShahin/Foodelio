## Intro

Foodelio is a recipe finding webapp powered by the Spoontacular api.

## Use/Features

The webapp allows you to search for any recipe by typing a search word and filtering for diet (vegan or vegetarian) and type of cuisine (e.g. Italian, Chinese, French, etc.). It will return a grid of recipes that match your search with a recipe title, picture, estimated time, and yield. Clicking on the respective recipe will take you to the website with the actual published recipe. It is built with Javascript/jquery and hosted with Google Firebase at https://foodelio.web.app/
